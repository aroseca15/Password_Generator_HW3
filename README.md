With all of the stress of my car accident, I forgot to git push my items regularly. It will not happen again.

I worked with my tutor on the first half of the assignment before the accident. He said that it is a good idea to get in the habit of setting up the proper pathways for the invaild options as well as the vaild. 

For a couple days I was stumped on how to communicate the valid and connect it to the invalid pathways. I tried 'if, else' statements, but it did not work. In the end, my tutors were right. I put all of the invalid and valid in separate 'if'statements.

It works great, I just wish I could condense it. 


All of my focus went to the assignment in general. I will pay better attention the pushes and deployments.
